## Synopsis

Storm data provided by National weather services, US is the primary data source
for this analysis. The storm data for the period of 1950-2011 has been summerized
by storm categories to aggregate total economic loss, injuries and fatalities. 
The type of storm that poses maximum risk of economic loss and casualities have 
been identified. Also, a graphical summary of occurance of such events and their
impact is provided in this report.

## Data Processing

- The data has been downloaded from National weather service website.

```{r cache=TRUE}
inputURL<-"https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"

temp<-tempfile()
download.file(inputURL,temp)

stormData <- read.csv(bzfile(temp))

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
